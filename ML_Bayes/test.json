First, he attempted to redefine \u201cagent.\u201d The sense manifestly conveyed by his original defamatory claim was \u201cagent\u201d as an espionage term-of-art, referring to a clandestine operative. Now, however, we are to understand the congressman meant it almost benignly: agency as in \u201cjust acting on someone\u2019s behalf\u201d \u2013 maybe coincidentally, perhaps not attuned to the elevation of Russia\u2019s interests over America\u2019s.", "Second, asked about the dodgy dossier, Swalwell turned the tables and began to interrogate MacCallum rather than answer her questions. What part of the dossier, he demanded to know, had been disproved? (This echoed his risible explanation to Matthews that Trump was a Russian agent because Swalwell hadn\u2019t \u201cseen a single piece of evidence that he\u2019s not.\u201d)", "It is good news for the White House and Republicans that Democrats continue doubling down on the indefensible. Two points, though, ought to be made here.", "First, it is abundantly clear what Swalwell meant when he called Trump a Russian agent. At the time, the anti-Trump hopes for the Mueller probe were flying high, and the congressman was trying to be as razor\u2019s edgy as possible. When Trump was being described as a Russian agent, just like when the Obama Justice Department and the FBI branded former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page a Russian agent, the term had a very specific meaning. A foreign agent is a person who\u00a0knowingly engages in clandestine activities on behalf of a foreign power. Under our law, when the term is applied to an American citizen, \u201cclandestine activities\u201d means \u201cactivities [which] involve or are about to involve a violation of the criminal statutes of the United States.\u201d (FISA, section 1801(b)(2) \u2013 Title 50, U.S. Code.)", "The congressman was not accusing the president of the United States merely of \u201cacting on Russia\u2019s behalf\u201d \u2013 it was not a matter of Trump happening to have the same position as Putin on NATO, as Swalwell ridiculously claimed last night (it would be truer to say that Putin and Obama had the same position on Iran, which never seemed to bother Swalwell). In calling Trump a Russian agent, Swalwell was effectively accusing the president of knowingly and secretly committing and planning to commit federal crimes in furtherance of Russia\u2019s interests. Espionage, the patent suggestion in Swalwell\u2019s accusation, is an egregious federal felony.", "The Russian government is a murderous, anti-American regime \u2013 one of the most dangerous and capable in the world. If a president truly were a Russian agent, that president should not only be impeached and removed, but prosecuted and imprisoned. But to accuse a president of such a thing on scant evidence \u2013 actually, on partisan propaganda \u2013 is a disgrace. To persist in rationalizing the smear, now that it has been rejected after Mueller\u2019s lengthy, thorough investigation, is inexcusable.", "From their perspective, there are plenty of things, personal and policy-wise, over which Democrats can feel good about opposing President Trump, with all the dudgeon and hyperbole that stamp our politics. The \u201cRussian agent\u201d claim, however, is a slander. It is too bad that Swalwell can\u2019t bring himself to apologize, but he should at least have the decency to retract it.", "Second, as Swalwell would no doubt be the first to say if one of his own political allies was on the receiving end of libelous and criminal allegations, the burden of proof is on proponents of the dossier to prove the truth of its claims. In this country, you are not supposed to be able to make scandalous assertions and then dare skeptics to disprove them. The side relying on the claims has to verify them \u2013 particularly if the claims are used to obtain judicial warrants to spy and seize property.", "It could be that I am just put off by the \u201cI\u2019m a totally reasonable, bipartisan kinda guy\u201d veneer Swalwell assumes as he says totally unreasonable, rabidly partisan things. But it was tough to take his condescension when MacCallum tried to answer his challenge to refute the dossier. (I note in passing that Swalwell couldn\u2019t even get his set-up question right. Obviously meaning to ask MacCallum what part of the dossier had been disproved, Swalwell asked MacCallum, \u201cWhich part of it hasn\u2019t been proved factual?\u201d Of course, virtually none of its significant allegations has been proved factual.)", "MacCallum contended that, for example, the Michael Cohen Prague trip had been disproved. Oh, the congressman gleefully responded, well, if we believe Cohen about that, then we must also believe Cohen when he said Roger Stone gave Trump a heads-up that WikiLeaks was about to publish Democratic party emails. Mind you, (a) Mueller apparently believed Cohen on Prague but doubted him on Stone (neither allegation appears in the special counsel\u2019s many charging documents); and (b) House Democrats recently invited Cohen to testify at a hearing and, notwithstanding his multiple fraud and false statements convictions, repeatedly vouched for him. Perhaps Swalwell, who was a county district attorney for just a short time, was never trusted with a case involving a witness who lies about some things and tells the truth about others \u2013 though it is standard fare for prosecutors (and in everyday life).", "But the point is, it was for those who proffered the dossier to verify the key \u201ccollusion\u201d claim that Cohen was in Prague. It is not the burden of dossier naysayers to negate the allegation. And it is perfectly reasonable for naysayers to rely on a denial that Cohen has corroborated with his passport (which indicates no travel to the Czech Republic), coupled with the fact that if Cohen was in Prague when the dossier says he was, that would have been easy to verify. Swalwell can keep pretending that the dossier, which even Steele won\u2019t stand behind, is not a laughingstock, but it is he who looks absurd.", "As a lawyer, Congressman Swalwell ought to be embarrassed. Alas, that doesn\u2019t appear to be in his repertoire."], "type": "opinion"},

It proved beyond any doubt, for anyone from either side of the aisle willing to listen, that the deep state exists, respects no bounds on its power, has no allegiance to the truth, and, left unchecked, threatens the very foundations of our constitutional democracy.", "This is not to say there is a coordinated group of conspirators that gathers in smoke-filled rooms; just that there is undeniably a power that comes with many government positions. While the majority of those in government are honorable people who respect the limits placed on their power by our Constitution and traditions, there are always those who believe they have a higher purpose, and are willing to use government power to manipulate events and further their political beliefs.

Some of those involved sincerely believed the unsubstantiated allegations of \u201cRussian collusion.\u201d Others always knew \u2013 or clearly should have known \u2013 that the claims against President Trump were politically motivated fabrications.", "Our nation and our institutions are strong, however, and this deep state effort failed to bring down our president. According to Attorney General William Barr\u2019s summary, Mueller concluded that his investigation \u201cdid not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities . . . despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.\u201d\u00a0That\u2019s definitive.", "True believers remain incredulous, but Mueller deserves credit for sticking to the truth despite the deep state pressure to do otherwise. He also deserves credit for taking an approach that enhanced his Report\u2019s credibility. While it took what seemed like an unduly long time to conclude the investigation, it was undeniably thorough.", "Mueller also assembled a team that included a number of Hillary Clinton supporters to investigate the claims of Russian collusion. The fact that even these potentially biased investigators were unable to find evidence of collusion following an extensive and unrestricted investigation is a compelling reason to believe the Mueller report\u2019s conclusion. In retrospect, it was a smart move by Mueller, enhancing his report\u2019s credibility. Had he hired a staff of Trump supporters, the Democrats could credibly have attacked the report as biased. Now, they cannot. Kudos to Special Counsel Mueller for that.", "Mueller declined to reach any conclusions on the charge of obstruction of justice, properly leaving it \u201cto the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime.\u201d After reviewing the report\u2019s findings, Barr stated that \u201cDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,\u201d stressing that this decision was made without regard to Department of Justice rules forbidding criminal prosecution of a sitting president.", "Rosenstein\u2019s involvement in that determination is significant. It was Rosenstein who appointed Mueller in the first place, and Rosenstein who authorized Mueller to investigate \u201cany matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\u201d \u2013 language that opened the door to investigating possible obstruction of justice. His concurrence in the Attorney General\u2019s no obstruction conclusion enhances its credibility.", "Let\u2019s be honest about it.
